# Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC)
   ### End Goal is to deliver high quality Product.

## Real life Example
    Example.com--> Building & delivering E-commerce 
                   Before Delivery we have phases
                   Planning --> Defining --> Designing --> Building --> Testing --> Deployment

Suppose Organization decides to include Kid section in their e-commerce website so, they have to go through these phases.

  * In planning phases you gathered the requirement. All core members will be involved. You can gather into from customers also.
  * We clearly define the requirements in documents like SRS, Document
  * High level design(choosing right technologies, ensuring seamless integration, and identifying potential problems before development begins) & low level design (Functions live Java Python,Â MySQL).

## Now the Next 3 phase are important for DevOps Automation.
     * Bullding Phase (Dev Engineer) --> Developing (Developer will write a Code).
     * Testing Phase (QA Engineer) --> In testing phase the Code which is in Git is pushed or deployed to server then QA Team will test the software.
     * Deployment --> Deploy to Production server
### DevOps Engineer will automate this process to make quick or fast delivery.

What are the Pillars of SDLC? and as a DevOps Engineer which components or pillars are you Intrested?
